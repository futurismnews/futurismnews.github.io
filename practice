<p>Public hearings on VRAITIS, Virtual Reality Addiction Induced Total Isolation Syndrome, continued through Wednesday this week as public health officials respond to concerns of millions of across the world who have lost contact with family and friends afflicted with the syndrome. Experts in the fields of computer science, neurology, and sociology, among others, met before world leaders in the hopes of developing a way to get the millions lost to the digital coma back in to normal society while also respecting the demands of Reality Rights advocates across the globe. </p>
