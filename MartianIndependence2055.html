<p>
Today at 12:30pm EST the Head of the United Martian Planetary Council and Mayor of the Martian city Argyre and announced that the people of Mar’s two cities had voted in favor of the referendum to make the planet of Mars an Independent and Sovereign nation. A new charter has been put in place giving all resource rights and orbital authority to the United Martian Planetary Council, whom are elected annually by the 1.4 million citizens of Mars.
 </p>

<p>
The Head of the Council claimed this as a necessary step to allow the Martian government to more effectively regulate and manage resource mining and refining operations occurring on the Martian surface and in orbit. It also gives the Martian government expanded legal authority over orbital matters as well. “While we look forward to continue working with governments and corporations from Earth in matters of further human exploration and space-based resource acquisition, we recognize the time has come for us to put the interests of the Martian people first. We’re not going to let Mars become a mine for Earth based space companies unless they intend to give something in exchange to the people who live here.”
